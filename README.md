# Overview


This was a Unity Project completed by Drew Sant, Spencer Warner, Nick Velasquez, Nathan Cook, and Misael Payan. This is just a fun little demo based off of the tanks flash game from the early 2000's.
**USE THE LEFT AND RIGHT ARROW KEYS TO MOVE, UP AND DOWN TO ADJUST TURRET, AND SPACEBAR TO SHOOT**

The purpose of this project was to test our communication efforts, teamwork, coding, and environment set-up skills. The latter was tested a lot. We wanted to embrace our creativity and have fun at the same time.
