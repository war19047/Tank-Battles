# Overview


I worked with fellow classmates to create a working game in Unity 2D. The idea was to recreate the classic tank game where you take turns shooting projectiles at the other tank. The game is played by aiming the tank up and down in hopes that you can hit the other player. The game is still a work in progress because all of the features have not been implemented. I am working on adding terrain and a power element to the game to adjust the velocity of the projectiles. Our team wanted to learn a new technology and programming language. C# was new to everyone on the team and presented a manageable challenge to learn the Unity environment as well as C#.

The Game is played by:
**USE THE LEFT AND RIGHT ARROW KEYS TO MOVE, UP AND DOWN TO ADJUST TURRET, AND SPACEBAR TO SHOOT**

The purpose of this project was to test our communication efforts, teamwork, coding, and environment set-up skills. The latter was tested a lot. We wanted to embrace our creativity and have fun at the same time.
